Hello Everyone,
I'm "new" to this...actually, I'm very old to this.  As a young man right out of college, I did lots of development work in COBOL on VAX/VMS.  I went into the Air Force when PCs came out and because I was learning the new and exciting field of aviation, I did not keep up on tech stuff.  Now, as I wind my career down as a pilot, I'm trying to make sense of it all, and my mind is literally melting.  Any tips you can give me would be greatly appreciated.
OK, I hear the sound of the world's smallest violin playing...
